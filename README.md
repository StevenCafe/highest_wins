# 🕹️ Highest Wins!

A 3D platform-jumping game built with Three.js and crafted entirely through a series of creative prompts to ChatGPT.


## 🎮 Overview

This project was co-created with ChatGPT, which generated the core code, physics, and design based on a sequence of developer prompts. 

It was then `integrated with the VIVERSE Worlds` using the [VIVERSE SDK](https://docs.viverse.com/developer-tools) to include login, avatar, and leaderboard features. Utimately, the game was published on the VIVERSE Worlds platform.

## 🧠 Development Story

This game emerged from an iterative conversation between me and ChatGPT. Each stage — from physics tuning to camera control and character behavior — was guided by my own prompts and ChatGPT’s generated responses.
You can explore the original prompts I used (included in [PROMPTS.md](PROMPTS.md)) to see how the project evolved prompt-by-prompt.
